# Skills

Characters in Cepheus Engine games engage in a variety of activities, using their various skills to accomplish the challenges that confront them.

## Skill Checks

Skill checks use the core task resolution system to resolve actions. Roll 2D6, add any skill levels and appropriate characteristic modifier, plus difficulty modifiers. If the result is 8 or higher, you succeed.

### Skill Check Formula

**2D6 + Skill Level + Characteristic Modifier + Difficulty Modifier ≥ 8 = Success**

### Task Difficulty

| Difficulty | Modifier | Description |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Simple | +6 | Routine task |
| Easy | +4 | Simple task |
| Routine | +2 | Standard task |
| Average | +0 | Default difficulty |
| Difficult | -2 | Challenging task |
| Very Difficult | -4 | Hard task |
| Formidable | -6 | Extreme task |

### Untrained and Zero-Level Skills

- **Untrained** - Character has no training in the skill: -3 DM penalty
- **Zero-Level** (Skill-0) - Character has minimal training: no bonus, but avoids -3 penalty

**Example:** To advance from Piloting 2 to Piloting 3 with a Skill Total of 3 requires (3 + 3) = 6 weeks of training.

| -6 or lower | Exceptional Failure |
| -1 to -5 | Failure |

Exceptional successes and failures provide special benefits or penalties depending on the skill and situation.
