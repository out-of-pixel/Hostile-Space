# Adventures

Adventures are the stories that your characters experience in the Cepheus Engine universe. This section provides guidance for creating and running adventures.

## What is an Adventure?

An adventure is a story created by the Referee and players, comprised of a series of related scenes or encounters. Adventures can resolve quickly within a single session or spread across multiple sessions.

Each adventure typically consists of:

- An **Introduction** that draws the player characters into the situation
- A **Middle** with challenges, obstacles, and encounters
- A **Conclusion** that resolves the main conflict

## Creating an Adventure

### Step 1: Concept

Start with a central idea or premise. What is the adventure about? What do the player characters need to do?

Examples:
- Rescue a missing person from pirates
- Deliver cargo while being hunted by rivals
- Explore ancient ruins on a remote world
- Uncover a corporate conspiracy
- Escape from imprisonment

### Step 2: Plot Elements

Develop the main plot thread and secondary complications:

- **Main Plot** - The primary goal and challenge
- **Complications** - Events that make the task harder
- **Twists** - Unexpected revelations or reversals
- **Red Herrings** - Misleading clues or encounters

### Step 3: Encounters

Design encounters for combat, social interaction, and challenges:

- **Combat Encounters** - Battles with enemies
- **Social Encounters** - Negotiation, interrogation, or persuasion
- **Exploration Encounters** - Discovering locations and clues
- **Environmental Encounters** - Hazards and obstacles

### Step 4: Non-Player Characters

Create memorable NPCs:

- **Patrons** - NPCs who hire the party for jobs
- **Allies** - NPCs who help the party
- **Enemies** - NPCs who oppose the party
- **Neutral Parties** - NPCs with their own agendas

### Step 5: Rewards

Determine what player characters gain:

- **Credits** - Payment for completing objectives
- **Experience** - Skill advancement opportunities
- **Equipment** - New gear or weapons
- **Information** - Clues for future adventures
- **Reputation** - Increased standing with factions
