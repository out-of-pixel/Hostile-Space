# Introduction to the Cepheus Engine

Welcome to the Cepheus Engine System Reference Document, which outlines the core rules used by a Classic Era Science Fiction 2D6-Based Open Gaming System.

## What is Roleplaying?

A roleplaying game (RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through structured decision-making and character development.

Actions taken within Cepheus Engine play succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. A session of Cepheus Engine play is conducted through discussion. One player, the **Referee**, arbitrates decisions based on the rules and presents the setting, while the other players each control a single character. Together, the Referee and players create a story.

## What is the Cepheus Engine?

The Cepheus Engine is a set of rules for conducting a game based on classic science fiction. Within these pages, you will find rules for:

- Creating characters
- Resolving tasks and conflicts
- Fighting other creatures
- Engaging in huge space battles
- Building worlds
- Enjoying interstellar trade
- Exploring new worlds
- And much more

The Cepheus Engine is inspired by classic science fiction games from the early days of roleplaying and shares similarities with these gaming systems. Material from older rules sets and those created under the Cepheus Engine are mutually compatible with only minimal adjustments required.

## To Play You Need

- A copy of the Cepheus Engine rules (these!)
- Several six-sided dice (2 minimum, but more is better)
- A pencil and some paper

## The Core Task Resolution System

The Cepheus Engine uses a core task resolution system to resolve actions. Whenever your character attempts any action with a chance of failure:

1. Roll two six-sided dice (2D6)
2. Add any relevant modifiers (characteristic, skill, difficulty, circumstances)
3. If the result equals or exceeds **8**, the action succeeds
4. If the result is lower than 8, the action fails

This simple system is used for nearly everything in the Cepheus Engine, with variations based on modifiers and the effects of success and failure.

## The Referee

Within the Cepheus Engine rules, one of the players assumes the role of **Referee**. The Referee:

- Organizes and runs the game
- Arbitrates questions regarding rules
- Acts as an officiant and moderator
- Weaves together the players' character stories
- Controls non-player characters (NPCs) and the environment
- Solves any player disputes

## The Characters

A **player character (PC)** is a fictional character whose actions are directly controlled by a player. **Non-player characters (NPCs)** are controlled by the Referee.

Using the Cepheus Engine rules as guidelines, players create characters reflecting the roles they'd like to have. Characters typically belong to a certain race and possess unique combinations of skills and expertise. Character attributes are given as numerical values that change as the character progresses and develops over the course of adventures.

## Characteristics

All characters have six basic characteristics that define what they are capable of doing:

- **Strength (Str)** - Physical strength and forcefulness
- **Dexterity (Dex)** - Physical coordination and reflexes
- **Endurance (End)** - Ability to sustain damage and stamina
- **Intelligence (Int)** - Intellect and quickness of mind
- **Education (Edu)** - Learning and experience
- **Social Standing (Soc)** - Place in society

Each characteristic has a numeric score, averaging 7 for normally capable humans. Higher scores grant bonuses (+1 or more) on task resolution checks, while lower scores apply penalties (as low as -2).

## Careers

Characters follow life paths called **careers**. The Cepheus Engine provides a variety of career options for characters to pursue, which opens opportunities to gain skills, characteristic improvements, and significant mustering-out benefits.

## Skills

**Skills** represent training in particular tasks or knowledge areas, from athletics and piloting to computer programming. Someone trained in Athletics can climb faster than someone untrained. Skills are measured in levels.

Each skill level represents roughly two years of education and training. Skill levels act as bonuses on task resolution rolls when you attempt actions related to that skill.

## Gameplay

Playing a session using the Cepheus Engine rules resembles verbally acting out chapters from a science fiction novel. Game sessions can last from one to five hours or more.

Each adventure is like its own story, consisting of a series of scenes. In general, most scenes consist of players interacting with NPCs and the universe created by the Referee. Players describe their actions; the Referee describes results. Certain situations, such as combat, have more structure and specific rules.

## Common Campaign Themes

On-going games using the Cepheus Engine typically revolve around a theme:

- **Colonial** - Settlement and development of new worlds
- **Commerce** - Merchant trading and cargo transport
- **Drifter** - Exploration as adventurers move from place to place
- **Espionage** - Spy missions and intelligence operations
- **Exploration** - Survey vessels discovering new worlds
- **Mercenary** - Military operations for hire
- **Political** - Social and political intrigue
- **Rebellion** - Civil war and government overthrow

## Difficulty and Effect

A check's **Difficulty** is a number set by the Referee that modifies your check result. When no Difficulty is given, assume **+0** Difficulty.

| Difficulty | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Simple | +6 |
| Easy | +4 |
| Routine | +2 |
| Average | +0 |
| Difficult | -2 |
| Very Difficult | -4 |
| Formidable | -6 |

The **Effect** is the difference between your check result and the target of 8:

| Effect | Result |
|--------|--------|
| -6 or lower | Exceptional Failure |
| -1 to -5 | Failure |
| 0 to +5 | Success |
| +6 or higher | Exceptional Success |

## Combat Round

When things get serious, time is divided into six-second segments called **rounds**. During a round, each character can perform:

- One significant action (about 3 seconds of action)
- One minor action (quick action like moving or drawing)
- Unlimited free actions
- Reactions as needed

## Types of Checks

### Skill Checks

A skill check determines what you can accomplish with a particular skill. Roll 2D6, add your skill levels and characteristic modifier, plus the Difficulty, against a target of 8.

### Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether you hit an opponent. It's essentially a skill check using your combat skill levels.

### Characteristic Checks

A characteristic check uses raw ability. Roll 2D6 and add the appropriate characteristic modifier when a task isn't covered by an obvious skill.

## Important Game Terms

- **2D6** - Two six-sided dice
- **Action** - A character activity
- **Check** - Rolling 2D6 plus modifiers to resolve an action
- **Difficulty** - A modifier applied to a check
- **Effect** - The difference between your roll and 8
- **Initiative** - The order characters act in combat
- **Round** - A six-second unit of combat time
- **Skill** - Training in a particular task or knowledge
- **Characteristic Score** - One of the six basic traits (Str, Dex, End, Int, Edu, Soc)
- **UPP** - Universal Persona Profile (character data in shorthand)

## Pseudo-Hexadecimal Notation

The Cepheus Engine uses pseudo-hexadecimal notation as shorthand for values 0-15 and beyond:

| 0-9 | 0-9 (normal numbers) |
| 10 | A |
| 11 | B |
| 12 | C |
| 13 | D |
| 14 | E |
| 15 | F |
| 16 | G |
| (continues A-Z, skipping I and O) |

This notation is used for characteristic scores, tech levels, and world statistics.

## Getting Started

1. Read through the rules, starting with Character Creation
2. Create your character
3. Gather dice, paper, and pencils
