## Characteristics

Characteristics measure a character's most basic abilities: how strong, dexterous, educated or intelligent they are. Characteristic scores influence almost everything your character does.

### The Six Characteristics

- **Strength (Str)** - Physical strength, fitness and forcefulness
- **Dexterity (Dex)** - Physical coordination and agility, reflexes
- **Endurance (End)** - Ability to sustain damage, stamina and determination
- **Intelligence (Int)** - Intellect and quickness of mind
- **Education (Edu)** - A measure of learning and experience
- **Social Standing (Soc)** - A character's place in society

### Characteristic Modifiers

Characteristic scores produce modifiers that affect checks:

| Score Range | Modifier |
|------------|----------|
| 0-2 | DM-2 |
| 3-5 | DM-1 |
| 6-8 | DM+0 |
| 9-11 | DM+1 |
| 12-14 | DM+2 |
| 15-17 | DM+3 |
| 18-20 | DM+4 |
| 21+ | Higher |

### Generating Characteristics

Roll 2D6 six times and record them in standard order: Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, and Social Standing. Alternatively, with your Referee's approval, assign the rolled results based on your character concept.

## Background Skills

Before embarking on your careers, you get background skills equal to 3 + your Education DM.

The first two background skills must be chosen from your homeworld (based on its trade codes or law level). The remaining skills come from the education list.
