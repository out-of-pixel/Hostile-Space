# Personal Combat

Personal combat is a common means of resolving conflicts in the Cepheus Engine. Combat is resolved in six-second rounds, with characters acting in order of their Initiative.

## Combat Overview

Combat proceeds in the following sequence:

1. **Determine Awareness** - Referee determines who is aware of opponents
2. **Roll Initiative** - Characters not already aware roll 2D6 + Dexterity DM
3. **Act in Initiative Order** - Characters take actions in descending order
4. **Resolve Damage** - Apply damage to targets who were hit
5. **Repeat** - Continue until combat ends

## Initiative

Roll 2D6 and add your Dexterity DM. If some combatants are aware and others are not, aware characters get an automatic 12 + Dexterity DM.

Initiative determines:
- The order characters act
- How many points you have to spend on reactions
- When you can interrupt others' actions

## The Combat Round

Each round lasts approximately 6 seconds of game time. Each character gets:
- One **significant action** (about 3 seconds of action)
- One **minor action** (quick action like drawing a weapon or moving)
- Unlimited **free actions** (shouting, etc.)
- Reactions (taken when others act)

## Actions

### Significant Actions

- **Attack** - Making a melee or ranged attack
- **Miscellaneous** - Complex skill check or action requiring focus

### Minor Actions

- **Aim** - Spend a minor action to get +1 DM on next attack (stacks up to +6)
- **Movement** - Move up to 6 meters
- **Draw/Reload** - Draw a weapon or reload (depends on weapon)
- **Change Stance** - Switch between standing, crouching, prone

### Free Actions

- Shout a warning
- Check your watch
- Push a button
- Other quick actions

## Range

Combat range determines attack difficulty:

| Range | Distance | Difficulty |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Personal | &lt;1.5 m | Close quarters |
| Close | 1.5-3 m | +0 to -2 |
| Short | 3-12 m | Varies by weapon |
| Medium | 12-50 m | Varies by weapon |
| Long | 51-250 m | Hard (-2 to -4) |
| Very Long | 251-500 m | Very Hard (-4 to -6) |
| Distant | 500+ m | Formidable (-6) |

## Attack Difficulties by Weapon Type

| Weapon | Close | Short | Medium | Long | V. Long |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Close Quarters | Average | Difficult | — | — | — |
| Thrown | Average | Difficult | Difficult | — | — |
| Pistol | Average | Average | Difficult | V. Difficult | — |
| Rifle | Difficult | Average | Average | Average | Difficult |
| Shotgun | Average | Difficult | Difficult | V. Difficult | — |
| Assault Weapon | Average | Average | Average | Difficult | V. Difficult |

## Making an Attack

Roll 2D6 and add:
- Relevant combat skill level
- Appropriate characteristic modifier (Strength or Dexterity for melee, Dexterity for guns)
- Difficulty modifier from range
- Any other modifiers (aiming, cover, environmental)

If the total is 8+, you hit and deal damage.

### Attack Types

**Melee Attack:** 2D6 + Melee Combat Skill + (Strength or Dexterity DM)

**Shooting Attack:** 2D6 + Gun Combat Skill + Dexterity DM

**Thrown Attack:** 2D6 + Athletics + Dexterity DM

## Damage

Each weapon lists damage as a number of D6. Add the Effect of your attack roll to this damage.

**Example:** A rifle does 2D6+2 damage. If you hit with an Effect of 3, you roll 2D6, add 2, then add 3 for total damage.

### Armor

Armor reduces damage by its rating. A hit with Effect 6+ always deals at least 1 point of damage.

### Characteristic Damage

Damage is first applied to Endurance. When Endurance reaches 0, further damage goes to Strength or Dexterity (character's choice). When all three physical characteristics reach 0, the character dies.

| Damage State | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| 1+ characteristic damaged | Wounded |
| All 3 characteristics damaged | Seriously Wounded |
| 2 characteristics at 0 | Unconscious |
| 3 characteristics at 0 | Dead |

## Reactions

When someone attacks you, you can react by spending Initiative points.

### Dodging
- Cost: 2 Initiative points
- Effect: Attacker gets -1 DM, you get -1 DM on all checks until next round
- In cover: -2 DM to attack instead

### Parrying (Melee Only)
- Cost: 2 Initiative points
- Effect: Attacker suffers -DM equal to your Melee skill (minimum -1)
- You get -1 DM on all checks until next round

## Special Combat Situations

### Cover

| Cover Type | DM to Attacker |
|-----------|--------|
| 1/4 (small cover) | -0 |
| 1/2 (low wall) | -1 |
| 3/4 (trench) | -2 |
| Full (pillbox) | -4 |

Crouching or prone characters can use cover one step better.

### Stance

**Standing** - Normal rules apply

**Crouching** - Move at half speed; better use of cover; ranged attacks receive normal bonuses from cover

**Prone** - Cannot make melee attacks or dodge; -2 DM on ranged attacks against you (Personal range: +2 DM); can still parry

### Burst Fire

Firing multiple rounds from a weapon can increase accuracy or damage:

| Burst | To Hit | Damage |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 3 round | +1 | +1 |
| 4 round | +1 | +1D6 |
| 10 round | +2 | +2D6 |
| 20 round | +3 | +3D6 |
| 100 round | +4 | +4D6 |

### Grenades and Explosives

Grenades and explosives affect an area. Characters in the explosion can dodge for 1D6 damage reduction, or dive for cover for half damage (but end prone and lose next significant action).

### Suppression Fire

You can fire at cover around a target instead of the target directly:
- Roll attack with -2 DM against the cover
- Success means target must duck away, losing next action
- Effect of your attack becomes an Initiative penalty for the target

## Injury and Recovery

### Wounds

**Wounded** - At least one characteristic is damaged
- Heal naturally: 1D6 + Endurance DM per day of full rest
- Or: 1 + Endurance DM per day of active lifestyle

**Seriously Wounded** - All three physical characteristics damaged
- Can only hobble or crawl at 1.5 m per round
- Lose minor action in combat
- Heal: Endurance DM per day (may get worse with low Endurance)
- Requires surgery before other healing methods work

### Medical Treatment

**First Aid** - Applied within 5 minutes of injury
- Roll Medicine check
- Restore 2x Effect characteristic points (divided among characteristics)

**Surgery** - Treats seriously wounded characters
- Requires hospital or sickbay
- Roll Medicine check
- Success restores characteristic points like first aid
- Failure causes points equal to Effect as damage

**Medical Care** - Long-term treatment in hospital
- Restores 2 + Endurance DM + Medicine skill per day
- Requires full bed rest and hospital facility

## Vehicles in Combat

### Vehicle Damage

When vehicles take damage, roll on the damage table:

| Damage Roll | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 2-3 | Hull Hit |
| 4 | Drive Hit |
| 5 | Weapon Hit |
| 6 | Armor Hit |
| 7-8 | Hull Hit |
| 9 | Weapon Hit |
| 10 | Drive Hit |
| 11 | Sensors Hit |
| 12 | Hull Hit |

Taking three hits in the same location usually disables or destroys that system.

### Vehicle Actions

**Evasive Action** - Driver makes skill check; Effect acts as -DM to attacks

**Maneuvering** - Move without skill check; avoid obstacles, change fire arcs

**Ram** - Attack skill check; same rules as collision

**Stunt** - Perform acrobatics or unusual vehicle maneuvers; skill check required
