# Space Combat

Space combat is a scaled-up version of personal combat designed to handle starship engagements at great distances and high speeds.

## Space Combat Round

A space combat round represents approximately one minute of real time, much longer than personal combat rounds. During a space combat round:

1. Determine range between ships
2. Roll initiative
3. Declare actions and target selections
4. Resolve attacks
5. Apply damage
6. Repeat

## Initiative in Space Combat

Initiative in space combat uses 2D6 + Pilot DM. The character with the highest initiative total acts first and can make significant actions while others are acting.

Ships can take multiple actions if their crew is well-coordinated, depending on crew size and captain's skill.

## Range in Space Combat

| Range | Distance |
|-------|----------|
| Personal | Contact |
| Close | &lt;10,000 km |
| Short | 10,000-100,000 km |
| Medium | 100,000-1,000,000 km |
| Long | 1,000,000-10,000,000 km |
| Very Long | 10,000,000+ km |

## Weapons in Space Combat

### Turret Weapons

Turrets are rotating weapons that can engage multiple targets:

- **Laser Turret** - Standard energy weapon
- **Missile Turret** - Guided missiles
- **Particle Beam Turret** - High-energy beam

Each turret can engage one target per combat round.

### Bay Weapons

Bay weapons are large weapons integrated into a ship's structure:

- **Fusion Gun** - Massive energy weapon
- **Missile Bay** - Launches large missiles
- **Particle Beam Bay** - Huge particle weapon

Bay weapons are slow to aim and fire but deal tremendous damage.

### Spinal Weapons

Ships can be equipped with a single massive weapon running along the spine:

- **Spinal Laser** - Devastating energy weapon
- **Spinal Missile Launcher** - Launches largest missiles
- **Spinal Particle Beam** - Immense particle weapon

## Attacks in Space Combat

### Attack Roll

Roll 2D6 + Gunnery skill + appropriate modifier for weapon type:

- Turret weapons use Gunnery (Turret Weapons)
- Bay weapons use Gunnery (Bay Weapons)
- Spinal weapons use Gunnery (Spinal Mounts)

Add modifiers for:
- Range difficulty
- Target movement
- Ship maneuvers
- Targeting computer bonuses

Target number is 8, same as personal combat.

### Damage in Space Combat

Weapons in space combat deal damage in 1D6 increments. Damage hits different ship systems based on where the shot lands.

| System | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Hull | Reduces structural integrity |
| Armor | Protective layer, can be repaired |
| Power Plant | Supplies power to ship systems |
| Maneuver Drive | Controls ship movement |
| Jump Drive | Enables faster-than-light travel |
| Weapons | Turrets, bays, or spinal mounts |
| Sensors | Detection and targeting systems |
| Computer | Ship's AI/control system |

## Ship Maneuvers

### Normal Maneuver

Ships can move to a new position or change facing without a roll.

### Evasive Maneuver

Pilot makes a Piloting check:
- Success gives ship -1 DM to be hit
- Effect can stack with crew size
- Maneuver limits ship's own attacks

### Aggressive Maneuver

Pilot makes a Piloting check:
- Success gives ship +1 DM to hit with attacks
- Lowers ship's evasion (enemies get +1 DM to hit)

## Damage to Ships

When a ship takes damage:

1. Roll to determine which system is hit
2. Compare damage to armor and hull
3. Reduce durability or disable systems
4. Apply ongoing effects (fires, decompression, etc.)

### Hull Integrity

Each ship has Hull points and Structure points. When Hull is reduced to 0, further damage goes to Structure. When Structure reaches 0, the ship is destroyed.

### Power Plant Damage

Damage to the power plant can:
- Reduce available power (limiting actions)
- Cause overheating (system damage)
- Lead to catastrophic failure (ship destruction)

### Weapon Damage

Weapons with damage reduce to 0 become non-functional. Bay weapons and spinal mounts can be disabled but not destroyed except by extraordinary damage.

## Boarding Actions

Typically initiated when ships are at close range:

1. Attacking ship moves adjacent
2. Boarding party uses airlocks or cutting torches
3. Defensive crew prepares countermeasures
4. Personal combat ensues aboard target ship

Boarding rules are covered under Personal Combat in Vehicles.

## Missiles

Missiles can be launched at range:

- **Missile Defense** - Ship can shoot down missiles with point-defense
- **Evasion** - Pilot can perform evasive maneuver to dodge
- **Damage** - Missiles that hit deal 6D6 damage

## Escaping Combat

A ship can attempt to escape by jumping to hyperspace:

1. Make Navigation check to plot course
2. Make Engineering check to divert power
3. Execute jump (usually takes 1 minute)
4. Enemies can make attacks during jump preparation

## Ship Systems and Repair

Ships with damaged systems can:

- **Jury Rig** - Temporary fix (lasts 1D6 hours)
  - Requires appropriate skill check
  - -2 DM on system checks
- **Repair** - Permanent fix
  - Takes time based on damage severity
  - Requires workshop or ship's repair bay
  - Needs spare parts
- **Refit** - Full overhaul
  - Takes weeks or months
  - Requires starport facilities

## Pursuing and Fleeing

### Chase Mechanics

1. Fleeing ship makes Piloting check
2. Pursuing ship makes opposing Piloting check
3. Higher roll gains on the other
4. Repeat each round until gap closes (melee range) or one escapes

Modifiers apply based on:
- Ship performance
- Pilot skill
- Environmental hazards
- Damage to drives
