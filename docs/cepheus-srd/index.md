# Cepheus Engine System Reference Document

Welcome to the Cepheus Engine System Reference Document, which outlines the core rules used by a Classic Era Science Fiction 2D6-Based Open Gaming System.

## Overview

The Cepheus Engine is a set of rules for conducting a game based on classic science fiction. Within its pages, you will find rules on creating characters, resolving tasks, fighting other creatures and engaging in huge space battles, building worlds, enjoying the risks of interstellar speculative trading, exploring new worlds, and a host of other diverse activities.

The Cepheus Engine is inspired by classic science fiction games from the early days of roleplaying, and shares a lot of similarities with these gaming systems. Material from these older rules sets and those created under the Cepheus Engine are mutually compatible with only a minimum of adjustments required.

## Getting Started

To play, you need:
- A copy of the Cepheus Engine rules
- Several six-sided dice (2 minimum, but more is better)
- A pencil and some paper
