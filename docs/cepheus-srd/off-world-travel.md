# Off-World Travel

Off-world travel is a key component of the Cepheus Engine, enabling characters to explore new worlds, conduct trade, and seek adventure among the stars.

## Types of Travel

### Planetary Travel

Travel between locations on the same world using ground or air vehicles.

### Interplanetary Travel

Travel between worlds in the same system using non-FTL spacecraft:
- Takes weeks or months
- Uses chemical or ion drives
- Limited to single star system

### Interstellar Travel (Jump Travel)

Travel between star systems using Jump drives:
- Takes exactly 1 week per jump
- Consumes massive amounts of fuel
- Requires accurate astrogation
- Distance depends on Jump drive rating

## Starships

### Basic Starship Types

**Scouts** - Fast exploration vessels
- 100 tons typical
- High jump drive (Jump-2)
- Minimal firepower
- Crew of 2-3

**Traders** - Commercial cargo vessels
- 100-400 tons typical
- Moderate jump drive
- Light armament
- Crew of 2-6

**Warships** - Military combat vessels
- 1,000-10,000+ tons
- Heavy armor and weapons
- Powerful drives
- Large crews

**Liners** - Passenger vessels
- 400-1,000+ tons
- Comfortable accommodations
- Moderate security
- Large crew and passenger capacity

### Jump Drives

The Jump drive enables faster-than-light travel by transitioning a ship into an alternate dimension.

**Jump Range:**
- Jump-1: 1 parsec per week
- Jump-2: 2 parsecs per week
- Jump-3: 3 parsecs per week
- Etc.

**Fuel Requirements:**
- Requires 10% of ship tonnage in fuel per jump
- Must be Unrefined fuel (cannot use Jump near world)
- Refined fuel available at starports

**Jump Procedures:**
1. Navigate to jump point (100+ diameters from worlds)
2. Plot course for destination
3. Divert power to jump drive
4. Initiate jump (1 minute)
5. Spend 1 week in jump space
6. Arrive near destination world

### Navigation and Astrogation

**Navigation Skill** required to:
- Plot jump courses
- Determine location after jump
- Plot courses through normal space
- Make accurate astrogation calculations

Failed navigation can result in a **misjump** - arriving at random location with damage to ship.

## Journey Times

### Interplanetary Travel

| Propulsion | Travel Time |
|-----------|-------------|
| Ion Drive | Months to years |
| Maneuver Drive | Weeks to months |
| Reaction Drive | Days to weeks |

### Interstellar Travel

**Jump Travel:** Always 1 week per jump, regardless of distance

**Travel in Normal Space:** Depends on engine type
- Chemical/Ion: 6+ months between systems
- Maneuver Drive: Weeks at optimized speeds
- Jump Drive alone: 1 week to destination (after jump)

## Passengers and Cargo

### Passage Types

**Low Passage** - Budget travel
- 1,000 Credits per jump
- Shared crew quarters
- Minimal amenities

**Middle Passage** - Comfortable travel
- 10,000 Credits per jump
- Private cabin
- Good amenities

**High Passage** - Luxury travel
- 100,000+ Credits per jump
- Suite cabin
- Premium service

### Cargo Transport

Characters can earn money transporting cargo:

1. Find cargo at trading world
2. Purchase or accept contractual cargo
3. Transport to destination
4. Sell or deliver for profit
5. Profit = sale price - purchase price - fuel costs

Typical profit margins: 10-30% of cargo value

## Space Travel Encounters

During travel, ships might encounter:

- **Pirates** - Criminal ships seeking plunder
- **Navy Patrols** - Law enforcement vessels
- **Merchants** - Trade ships and convoys
- **Anomalies** - Space phenomena and hazards
- **Refugees** - Desperate people needing passage
- **Derelicts** - Abandoned or damaged vessels

## Hazards of Space Travel

### Misjump

A failed navigation or jump check can result in:
- Arrive at wrong location (1-6 parsecs off course)
- Take 2D6 damage to ship
- Possibly damage Jump drive
- Arrive in dangerous location

### Mechanical Failure

Ships can suffer:
- Engine breakdown (disabled drive)
- Life support failure (atmosphere loss)
- Hull breach (decompression)
- Computer malfunction (loss of navigation)

### Fuel Depletion

Running out of fuel means:
- Must use secondary propulsion (slow)
- May require rescue
- Can lead to stranding

## Life Support

Ships are designed to sustain crews:

**Life Support Cost:**
- 0.01 tons per crew member
- Typically covers 1 month
- Can be rationed (reduces to weeks)
- Failure means slow death from starvation/suffocation

## Communications

Ships can communicate across space:

- **Radio** - Limited speed-of-light range
- **Laser** - Tight-beam, hard to detect
- **Meson** - Cannot be jammed, limited use

Communication delays at distance:
- 1 AU away = 8 minutes one way
- 1 light-year away = 1 year one way

## Customs and Regulations

Arriving at a new world, ships must:

1. Request docking permission
2. Submit to inspection (Advocate check)
3. Pay docking fees
4. Declare cargo and passengers
5. Clear customs

**Customs Inspection:**
- Referee's choice based on law level
- Advocate check or Bribery to avoid inspection
- Smuggling and illegal cargo risk seizure
